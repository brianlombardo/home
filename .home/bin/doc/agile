+ individuals and interactions over processes and tools
+ working software over comprehensive documentation
+ customer collaboration over contract negotiation
+ responding to change over following a plan

+ our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through the early and continuous delivery of valuable software
+ welcome changing requirements, even late in development
  + agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage
+ deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale
+ business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project
+ build projects around motivated individuals
  + give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done
+ the most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation
+ working software is the primary measure of progress
+ agile processes promote sustainable development
  + the sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely
+ continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility
+ simplicity–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is essential
+ the best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams
+ at regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly' \
